The purpose of this document is to clearly identify:

* Objective
* Governance
* Finance and Budgeting
* 

### Objective
Establish a community founded on the recognition that Freedom of Speech (& Freedom of Assembly?) are unalienable rights bestowed by God or the Universe.

### Governance
Comprised of (odd no.) admins of equal standing - one person, one vote in all matters of decision making.

1. Underpinning Principles
   * Lassiez Faire administration - minimal intervention only as a last resort
   * Anti-censorship
   * Pro-transparency and accountability
   * Open communication
   * Impartiality
   * 100% self/user funded - no advertisers to avoid conflicts of interest

2. Requirements
   - [ ] Admin Code of Governance that all admins are to abide by and be held accountable to, including:
    * decision making/voting policy
    * user communication policy - no Discord
    * randomly selected focus group participants (from pre-selected larger/suitably experienced pool)
    * apply ToS to all users equally - no favouritism
    * no shadowbanning, default categories, manipulation of user feeds - tags to rplace categories (similar to Steam)
    * admin partcipation in user communities
   - [ ] Mod ToS - clearly defined responsibilities and conditions for exercising of Mod powers
   - [ ] User ToS - no brigading, process for breach of policy - 3 strikes? (can include UI?), appeals process
